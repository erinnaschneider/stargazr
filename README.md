## Description
Here at StarGazr, we believe it is a human right to have easy access to see the night sky. This application is dedicated to cataloging all of the best star gazing locations around the globe! Any amateur astronomer with access to the internet can choose StarGazr to share their favorite spots, find new favorite spots near or far, and help create and maintain the internet's biggest community for StarGazrs! 

## Installation
After cloning this repository, run _npm install_ in your terminal. A .env file with your own MySql login information will need to be added in order to access the database. From there, you can run _npm start_ to get the server going and you're on your way to being a StarGazr! If you want to skip all that, please see our deployed application link below ðŸ‘‡
